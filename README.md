<h1>Alphabet War Game ðŸ†š</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Alphabet War Game is a playful Java program where two teams of letters fight against each other. Each letter has its own strength, contributing to its teamâ€™s score. This fun little program showcases Java concepts like loops, conditionals, scanner inputs, and object-oriented programming.

<h2>Features</h2>
Interactive console-based gameplay.
Dynamic input from users.
Clear step-by-step outputs explaining how scores are calculated.
Multiple test scenarios with different outcomes.
Fun battle logic to determine the winner between left-side and right-side letters.
<h2>Rules</h2>
Left-side team:

'w' â†’ Strength 4
'p' â†’ Strength 3
'b' â†’ Strength 2
's' â†’ Strength 1
Right-side team:

'm' â†’ Strength 4
'q' â†’ Strength 3
'd' â†’ Strength 2
'z' â†’ Strength 1
If the left-side score is higher, the result will be "Left side wins!"

If the right-side score is higher, the result will be "Right side wins!"

If both scores are equal, the result will be "Let's fight again!"

<h2>How It Works</h2>
The program takes a word from the user as input.
It analyzes each letterâ€™s strength and adds it to the corresponding teamâ€™s score.
It displays the cumulative score as each letter is processed.
At the end, it declares the winner or a tie based on the final scores.
<h2>Usage</h2>
Input a word with any combination of the specified letters.
The program will calculate the scores step-by-step for both sides.
It prints the winner or a tie at the end.


<h1>Credit Card Validator ðŸ’³</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Credit Card Validator is a Java program that implements a validation algorithm to check whether a given credit card number is valid. The program demonstrates Java programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, string manipulations, and scanner input.

It performs step-by-step validation following the Luhn Algorithm, a standard algorithm used for verifying card numbers.

<h2>Features</h2>
Interactive console-based input for credit card numbers.
Real-time validation with step-by-step explanation of the process.
Works with 8 or 9-digit credit card numbers.
Checks digit calculation and comparison to validate card numbers.
Validation Process
The validation process follows these steps:

Input length check: The card number must have 8 or 9 digits.
Extract the last digit: This is the check digit.
Reverse the remaining digits for processing.
Double the digits at odd positions (0-based indexing). If a doubled value is more than 9, sum its individual digits.
Sum all the digits to get the total cumulative sum.
Calculate the check digit using the formula:
CheckÂ digit=(10âˆ’(sum%10))%10
Compare the calculated check digit with the last digit from the original input. If they match, the card is valid.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Input a credit card number in the console.
The program will display each step of the validation process.
At the end, the program will tell whether the card is valid or invalid.
